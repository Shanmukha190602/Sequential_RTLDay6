The shift register which allows serial input parallel output is known as the **SIPO shift register.**
In the SIPO register, the term SIPO stands for **serial input parallel output.**
In this type of shift register, the input data is given bit by bit serially. 
For each clock pulse, the input data at all the FFs can be shifted by a single position. 
The o/p at every flip-flop can be received parallel.
